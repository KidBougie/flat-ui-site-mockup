# Title
Recreate the following web page

# Estimated Time
10 hours

## Summary
This is a project to reinforce front-end principles, and focus on front end best practices and mobile responsiveness.

## Instruction
* Set up a Github repository for this project.
* Create a new HTML document.
* Think about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.
* Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty `<div>` elements that are appropriately sized and positioned. You may want to make their background colors different so you can see them. Don't forget to use your browser's developer tools (right click on the page, click "inspect element")!
* Don't worry about enclosing every paragraph of text in `<p>` tags.
* Push your solution to Github.

# Objectives
- use modern front-end design techniques
- use flexbox to arrange items on a page
